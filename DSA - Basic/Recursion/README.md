# Recursion
#### The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.

**How memory is allocated to different function calls in recursion?**

When any function is called from main(), the memory is allocated to it on stack. A recursive function calls itself, the memory for called function is allocated on top of memory allocated to calling function and different copy of local variables is created for each function call. When the base case is reached, the function returns its value to the function by whom it is called and memory is de-allocated and the process continues.

**Disadvantage of Recursion:**
Note that both recursive and iterative programs have same problem solving powers, i.e., every recursive program can be written iteratively and vice versa is also true. Recursive program has greater space requirements than iterative program as all functions will remain in stack until base case is reached. It also has greater time requirements because of function calls and return overhead.

**Advantages of Recursion:**
Recursion provides a clean and simple way to write code. Some problems are inherently recursive like tree traversals, Tower of Hanoi, etc. For such problems it is preferred to write recursive code. We can write such codes also iteratively with the help of stack data structure.

**Tail Recursion:** 
A recursive function is said to be following Tail Recursion if it invokes itself at the end of the function. That is, if all of the statements are executed before the function invokes itself then it is said to be following Tail Recursion.

**Which one is Better-Tail Recursive or Non Tail-Recursive?**

The tail-recursive functions are considered better than non-tail recursive functions as tail-recursion can be optimized by compiler. The idea used by compilers to optimize tail-recursive functions is simple, since the recursive call is the last statement, there is nothing left to do in the current function, so saving the current functionâ€™s stack frame is of no use.
