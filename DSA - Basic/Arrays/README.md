# Array
#### An array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

**Insert** - O(n)\
**Search** - O(n) for unsorted arrays, O(log n) for sorted arrays\
**Delete** - O(n)\
**Accessing i-th element** - O(1)\
**Updating i-th element** - O(1)

## Advantages of using arrays:
#### 1. Arrays allow random access of elements. This makes accessing elements by position faster.
#### 2. Arrays have better cache locality that can make a pretty big difference in performance.
